### welcome to michael's public notes

these are my personal notes, publicly shared.

> [!FAQ]- what is this?
> 
> some of my personal notes.
> notes on things i've read, watched, heard, `sources`
> notes on things i've seen, thought, felt, `scribbles`
> notes on things i've learned from others, `summaries`
> and lists of notes, curated as i see fit. `sets`
> 
> Public Notes, Second Brain, and Digital Gardens are all similar concepts inspired by something called Zettelkasten Method. 
> 
> essentially, i capture thoughts as notes, then try to find patterns between notes. linking notes to do better thinking â€“ or 'linking the thinking'. sharing it along the way to curate content, invite engagement, declutter your mind a little bit. 
> 
> since it's personal, i hope you kindly excuse the errors, brevity, informalities, and insufferability.
>  

> [!FAQ]+ why do this?
> 
> the goal is to make some use out of all the information i'm drowning
> in. to make some sense out of it, or at least clear it out of my
> mind, and share it along the way.
> 
> > [!FAQ]- what is it really about, though?
> > 
> > more formally, it's an attempt at Personal Knowledge Management (PKM), based on the Zettelkasten, a method developed by a german social scientist who published 50 books and 600 articles using it.
> > 
> > basically, the idea of Zettelkasten is to write atomic notes, tag them, and find non-linear patterns â€“ linking the notes to do better thinking, or 'linking the thinking'.
> > 
> > we're all drowning in thoughts, content, and information. this is an attempt to learn how to swim.
> > 
> > building on that, Molecular Notes helped me categorize notes as original observations (molecules), learned concepts (atoms), and their references (resources). PARA Method taught me that 4 is the maximum number of buckets to hold in your brain comfortably, and that those 4 could be projects, areas, resources, and archive.
