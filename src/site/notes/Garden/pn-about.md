# ðŸ‘‹ welcome

these are my personal notes, publicly shared.

annotated bookmarks



why do this?

how do i start?


- [sources]([[stream/pn-sources\|pn-sources]]) are things i've read, watched, heard
- [scribbles]([[Garden/_settings/templates/PN-scribbles\|pn-scribbles]]) are things i've seen thought, felt, noticed 
- [stars]([[Garden/_settings/templates/PN-stars\|pn-stars]]) notes on things i've learned from others
- [`sets]([[Garden/_settings/templates/PN-sets\|pn-sets]])


you can `search` for anything (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`)

> [!FAQ]- what is this?
> 
> Public Notes, Second Brain, and Digital Gardens are all similar concepts inspired by the Zettelkasten Method.
> 
> essentially, i capture thoughts as notes, then try to find patterns between notes. linking notes to do better thinking â€“ or 'linking the thinking'. sharing it along the way to curate content, invite engagement, declutter your mind a little bit. 
> 
> since it's personal, i hope you kindly excuse the errors, brevity, informalities, and insufferability.

> [!FAQ]+ why are you doing this?
> 
> the goal is to make some use out of all the information i'm drowning
in. to make some sense out of it, or at least clear it out of my
mind, and share it along the way.
> 
> > [!FAQ]- what is it really about, though?

> > more formally, it's an attempt at [Personal Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) (PKM), based on the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#a-zettelkasten-is-a-personal-tool-for-thinking-and-writing), a method developed by a german social scientist who published 50 books and 600 articles using it.

> > basically, the idea of Zettelkasten is to write atomic notes, tag them, and find non-linear patterns â€“ linking the notes to do better thinking, or 'linking the thinking'.
> > 
> > we're all drowning in thoughts, content, and information. this is an attempt to learn how to swim.

> > building on that, [Molecular Notes](https://reasonabledeviations.com/2022/04/18/molecular-notes-part-1/) helped me categorize notes as original observations (molecules), learned concepts (atoms), and their references (resources). [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) taught me that 4 is the maximum number of buckets to hold in your brain comfortably, and that those 4 could be projects, areas, resources, and archive.
