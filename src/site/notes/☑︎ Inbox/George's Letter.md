George's (First) Letter:

> Dear Matt,
> 
> Oh, I am so so sorry for your loss. That must be just unspeakably difficult. I'm glad the book is saying something to you. 
> 
> I don't really know what to say, except that someone told me this recently, that **grief is a form of praise. You are praising the wonder of the person you lost. The great pain you are feeling means great love. I can't imagine that helps but it is true.**
> 
> It is like cause and effect. You really saw anew and cherished her. That's what your grief is proving. And proving that she was wonderful and that you appreciated that.
> 
> If you'll allow me for one more thought, I'm 58. It feels like no time at all has passed since I was your age.
> 
> Soon you will be here. I wonder if it helps to ask yourself, What am I going to do with that very short time I will have before I see my loved one again?
> 
> **The more you do, the more you love, and the more lives you touch, the better. You are here for both of you now.**
> 
> Of course, I don't know you and I hope I haven't offended or over advised. But my heart goes out to you, brother. And my prayers.
> 
> All the best,
> George

From the second letter:

> ...I will say this, you have known love and known loss. Your work with epilepsy groups will mean that you are minimizing loss and suffering in the world. You feel to me like the kind of person who is going to take this pain and convert it into goodness. For others, for you, for Erica in her good memory.
